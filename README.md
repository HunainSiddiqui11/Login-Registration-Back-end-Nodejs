# Login-Registration-Back-End-Nodejs
Project Description:

This project is a web application for user registration and authentication, developed using Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, HTML, and CSS. The application allows users to register with their personal information such as first name, last name, email, contact number, and password. Upon registration, the user's data is stored securely in a MySQL database.

The application also includes a login functionality where users can authenticate themselves using their email and password. Upon successful login, users are redirected to the home page. If the login attempt fails due to incorrect credentials, an appropriate error message is displayed.

Additionally, the project incorporates error handling for scenarios such as duplicate user registration and invalid routes. When a user attempts to register with an email that is already associated with an existing account, they receive a notification indicating that the email is already registered. Similarly, if a user navigates to an invalid route, a custom 404 error page is displayed.

The project aims to provide a seamless and secure user registration and authentication experience while demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end web development technologies.
